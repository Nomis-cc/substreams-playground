PancakeSwap direct to database example
--------------------------------------

DEVELOPER PREVIEW

This example brings the Sparkle technology to Substreams, doing
ingestion into PostgreSQL as an end-to-end The Graph indexer.

You can then query `graph-node` using the normal PancakeSwap V2
GraphQL layer, and all the writing is done by this program.

This process will most likely end up directly in `graph-node`
eventually.
